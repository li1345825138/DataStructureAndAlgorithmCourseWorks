   zijie              CS210 grad    solving UFPercolation open() method

4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Array Percolation)
       Approach:
       Implement all the interface method from Percolation interface.
       Implement self method floodFill().
       Use data\input10.txt and data\input-no.txt to verify the result.

       Issues and resolution: When I first try to solve the floodFill() method,
       I was confused with fill direction, and I start to look back into the pdf picture
       and description, I figure out it was about moving base on i and j.

   Problem 2 (Union Find Percolation)
       Approach:
       Implement all the interface method from Percolation interface.
       Implement self method encode().
       Use data\input10.txt and data\input-no.txt to verify the result.

       Issues and resolution:
       I had a difficult time with solving UFPercolation open() method, because of checking four side of block and union them,
       and then I got the solution from my friend is already take CS210 in previous to solve problem

   Problem 3 (Estimation of Percolation Threshold)
       Approach:
       Implement all method inside PercolationStats
       Test PercolationStats with argument 100 and 1000
       Answer verified

       Issues and resolution:
       The IndexOutOfBounce exception causing on construct because of n + 1 mistake
       fix by change n + 1 to n.
